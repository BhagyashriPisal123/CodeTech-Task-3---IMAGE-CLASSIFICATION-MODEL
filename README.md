Company : CodeTech IT Solutions

Name : Bhagyashri Sharad Pisal

Intern ID : CT4MOTH

Domain : Machine Learning

Duration : 4 Months 

Mentor : Neela Santosh Kumar


##DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL TASK : - *Tools and Libraries Used- Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation. TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library used for building and training the CNN model. Keras: A high-level API within TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building neural networks. layers: Used to define the layers of the CNN. models: Used to create the sequential model. Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data and model performance. Numpy: Used for numerical operations, particularly for array manipulation when dealing with the CIFAR-10 dataset. I will use Google Colab that allows writing and executing Python code in the browser. It supports collaboration, free GPU access, and is ideal for machine learning and image classification tasks.. *Task Applicability- Image Recognition: The CNN model can be applied to various image recognition tasks in fields such as healthcare (medical image analysis), autonomous vehicles (object detection), and security (facial recognition). Computer Vision: The model can be used in applications that require understanding and interpreting visual information from the world. Real-time Image Classification: The trained model can be deployed in applications that require real-time image classification, such as mobile apps or web services. Transfer Learning: The architecture can be adapted for transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a specific task with limited data.
